Overview

I developed this remake specifically for my vintage cocktail table arcade machine. While it's optimized for a 1024x1280 vertical monitor resolution, the game is compatible with other common resolutions as well. Configuration options such as resolution and control settings can be customized via the settings.ini file.

Features

    Controls: Use the arrow keys or joystick to control direction.
    Multiplayer Support: The game supports 0 to 4 players.
    Customizable Keys: Default keys can be modified in settings.ini. Refer to pygame_keys.txt in the utils folder for key constants.

Gameplay

    Scoring: Earn points by surviving a round.  Avoid crashing into walls, other players or yourself.

	Exit: ESC

Legacy

Checkmate is a color version of the eponomous 1977 Midway coin-op game. It was one of four programs built into all Bally Professional Arcade and Astrocade systems; they are part of the 8K System ROM. The approximate size of the game is 1201 bytes.
